Neos SEO |version| Documentation
================================

This documentation covering version |release| has been rendered at: |today|

Page title
----------

The default `<title>` tag rendering in the `TYPO3.Neos:Page` TypoScript object is a "reverse breadcrumb" of the regular
title field(s). This is done in `head.titleTag.default`.

A new field `titleOverride` is added to `TYPO3.Neos:Document` via the `TYPO3.Neos.Seo:TitleTagMixin`. The new field is
used as the `<title>` tag content if it is filled (see `head.titleTag.content` in `TYPO3.Neos:Page`).

Basic meta tags
---------------

The fields for keywords and description are added to `TYPO3.Neos:Document` via the `TYPO3.Neos.Seo:SoeMetaTagsMixin`

If they are filled in, `<meta>` tags for their contents will be rendered (see `head.metaTitleTag` and
`head.metaDescriptionTag` in `TYPO3.Neos:Page`).

Two checkboxes allow to set the content for the `<meta name="robots">` tag to any combination of the possible values `follow`, `nofollow`, `index` and `noindex`.

Twitter Cards
-------------

The `TYPO3.Neos.Seo:TwitterCardMixin` (added to `TYPO3.Neos:Document` by default) provides a new inspector tab to
configure Twitter Cards on any document. If a Twitter Card is enabled, the related meta tags will be rendered as needed
and useful.

The `twitter:site` handle can be configured with the setting `TYPO3.Neos.Seo.twitterCard.siteHandle` by providing a valid Twitter handle::

  TYPO3:
    Neos:
      Seo:
        twitterCard:
          siteHandle: '@typo3neos'

Check the documentation on https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview for more on Twitter Cards.

Open Graph
----------

The `TYPO3.Neos.Seo:OpenGraphMixin` (added to `TYPO3.Neos:Document` by default) provides a new inspector tab to
configure Open Graph on any document.
The Open Graph protocol enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph. The essential ones are:

* `og:type`
* `og:title`
* `og:description`
* `og:image`
* `og:url`

In general Open Graph tags are just shown if they have given data, because otherwise Facebook for example will extract data for the generated view from the site itself. So fallbacks are not needed. If you are not satisfied with the generated view you should define your own.
If a Open Graph Type is enabled, the related meta tags will be rendered according to following rules.

* `og:title` is only rendered if it includes data
* `og:description` will use `meta:description` as a fallback or show nothing
* `og:url` the URL of the document
* `og:image` is only rendered if it includes data

XML sitemap
-----------

The generation of an XML sitemap to submit to search engines can be enabled as follows:

The change frequency and priority for each sitemap entry are used as specified in the respective fields added
to the SEO tab in the inspector of `TYPO3.Neos:Document` nodes via the `TYPO3.Neos.Seo:XmlSitemapMixin`. For
priority the default value is 0.5 (neutral) and the change frequency is omitted unless specified.

The generated sitemap does not contain information about the last modification of a document, because Neos does not yet
keep track of this.

For activating the rendering of the `sitemap.xml` you need to add the following route to the TYPO3.Neos.Seo package in your global `Configuration/Routes.yaml`.
Keep in mind that there are no tabs in YAML, but only two spaces for indentation.

Robots.txt
-----------

Editing the robots.txt often belongs to an SEO editor's tasks.
In a multi-domain installation you can thus serve multiple robots, which is not easily possible otherwise.
This features uses the CodeEditor because it fits best.
As there are no display conditions, you see the property on any page.
But only the one in the site node is being read and used.

If you are using a standard .htaccess, vhost or nginx config, you have to remove the robots.txt exception like

::

	# Stop rewrite processing no matter if a package resource, robots.txt etc. exists or not
	RewriteRule ^(_Resources/Packages/|robots\.txt|favicon\.ico) - [L]

	# Change to:
	RewriteRule ^(_Resources/Packages/|favicon\.ico) - [L]

::

	##
	# Neos Seo: XML Sitemap and robots.txt

	-
	  name: 'Neos Seo'
	  uriPattern: '<TYPO3NeosSeoSubroutes>'
	  subRoutes:
		'TYPO3NeosSeoSubroutes':
		  package: 'TYPO3.Neos.Seo'
		  variables:
			'xmlSitemapPath': 'sitemap.xml'
			'robotsTxtPath': 'robotsTxt'

	##
	# Neos subroutes

	...


There is no need for creating a document node for the sitemap or robots.txt as this route will work for all site nodes.

Alternate Language Tag
------------------------

The `Alternate Language Tag` provides information that the site is also available in other languages. By default the tags
are rendered with the `TYPO3.Neos:DimensionMenu` and the `language` dimension. Given the Neos Demo Site Package as an
example the rendered tags for the homepage would be.

::

  <link rel="alternate" hreflang="en_US" href="http://neos.dev/"/>
  <link rel="alternate" hreflang="en_UK" href="http://neos.dev/uk"/>

According to the following dimension settings, there would be a lot more tags expected. However only two variants of the
homepage exists, thus only `en_US` and its fallback `en_UK` are rendered.

::

  TYPO3CR:
    contentDimensions:
      'language':
        label: 'Language'
        icon: 'icon-language'
        default: 'en_US'
        defaultPreset: 'en_US'
        presets:
          'all': ~
          'en_US':
            label: 'English (US)'
            values: ['en_US']
            uriSegment: 'en'
          'en_UK':
            label: 'English (UK)'
            values: ['en_UK', 'en_US']
            uriSegment: 'uk'
          'de':
